# My Daily Log

### 29th July 2023
#### Started learning FastAPI
- **Source** - https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/
#### Python venv
- **Source** - https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
- **How venv works** - 
  - When a Python interpreter is running from a virtual environment, `sys.prefix` and `sys.exec_prefix` point to the directories of the virtual environment, whereas `sys.base_prefix` and `sys.base_exec_prefix` point to those of the base Python used to create the environment.
  - It is sufficient to check `sys.prefix` != `sys.base_prefix` to determine if the current interpreter is running from a virtual environment
