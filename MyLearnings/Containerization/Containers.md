## What are Containers
- Containers are executable units of software in which application code is packaged along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that the code can be run anywhere—whether it be on desktop, traditional IT or the cloud.

- To do this, containers take advantage of a form of operating system (OS) virtualization in which features of the OS kernel (e.g. Linux namespaces and cgroups, Windows silos and job objects) 
- Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers

## Why Containerization is better over VMs
- In traditional virtualization—whether it be on-premises or in the cloud—a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hypervisors">hypervisor</a> is leveraged to virtualize physical hardware. Each VM then contains a guest OS and a virtual copy of the hardware that the OS requires to run, along with an application and its associated libraries and dependencies.
