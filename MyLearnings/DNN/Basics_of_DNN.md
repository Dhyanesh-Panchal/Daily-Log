# Deep Neural Networks

### Perceptron
- We can say it is a single Neuron based Neural Network.
- A single-layer perceptron is the basic unit of a neural network. A perceptron consists of input values, weights and a bias, a weighted sum and activation function.

- It was later shown that the technology was only *linearly separable*, in other words, the perceptron was only able to work with linear separation of data points.
